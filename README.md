UNDER DEVELOPMENT CURRENTLY

# Home-Assistant
Personal repository for configuration files for Home Assistant. 

The files are what I have developed, with assistance of various forum users and reading and googling to search for examples to learn from. Others are welcome to utilise them, and suggestion enhancements and fixes, however no warranty is provided or implied and doing so is at ones own risk.

Files are located in folders that denote code that is used to compile binaries for ESPHome devices (i.e. ESP32, ESP8266 type devices) and HA yaml configration files, that are located in the /packages directory.
